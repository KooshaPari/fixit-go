# FIXIT
# A Basic Gin/Svelte CRUD Web Project
## A basic learning project in Go/Svelte for me to find my bearings before rebuilding it in SvelteKit/Loco.rs
## A prelude to BytePort and NanoVMS

Currently Functionally Complete Such That:
Users Can Add, Update, View, and Remove Todos
Todos have an id, title, description, dueDate (as string, dates will not be implemented), and Done bool which is currently unused.


UI is abysmal, priority #1
